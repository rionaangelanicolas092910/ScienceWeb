<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:left; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;"><b>Water cycle</b> is a cycle that involves the continuous circulation of water in the Earth-atmosphere system. 
Of the many processes involved in the  cywatercle, the most important are evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. Although the total amount of water 
within the cycle remains essentially constant, its distribution among the various processes is continually changing.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:left; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
<b>Evaporation</b>, one of the major processes in the cycle, is the transfer of water from the surface of the Earth to the atmosphere. By evaporation, water in the liquid state 
is transferred to the gaseous, or vapor, state. This transfer occurs when some molecules in a water mass have attained sufficient kinetic energy to eject themselves from the 
water surface.</p>




<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:left; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;"><b>Transpiration</b> is the evaporation of water through minute pores, or stomata, in the leaves of plants. 
For practical purposes, transpiration and the evaporation from all water, soils, snow, ice, vegetation, and other surfaces are lumped together and called evapotranspiration, or 
total evaporation.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:left; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;"><b>Water vapor</b> is the primary form of atmospheric moisture. Although its storage in the atmosphere 
is comparatively small, water vapor is extremely important in forming the moisture supply for dew, frost, fog, clouds, and precipitation.
The transition process from the vapor state to the liquid state is called condensation.</p>


<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:left; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;"><b>Condensation</b> may take place as soon as the air contains more water vapor than it can receive from a 
free water surface through evaporation at the prevailing temperature. This condition occurs as the consequence of either cooling or the mixing of air masses of different temperatures.
 By condensation, water vapor in the atmosphere is released to form precipitation.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:left; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">For <b>Precipitation</b> to happen, first tiny water droplets must condense on even tinier dust, salt, or smoke 
particles, which act as a nucleus, binding them together. Water droplets may grow as a result of additional condensation of water vapor when the particles collide. If enough 
collisions occur to produce a droplet with a fall velocity which exceeds the cloud updraft speed, then it will fall out of the cloud as precipitation. This is not a 
trivial task since millions of cloud droplets are required to produce a single raindrop.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:left; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">A more efficient mechanism for producing a precipitation-sized drop, is a process which leads to 
the rapid growth of ice crystals at the expense of the water vapor present in a cloud. These crystals may fall as snow, or melt then fall as rain. This process is known as 
the Bergeron-Findeisen process.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:left; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;"><i>Ice</i> also plays a role in the water cycle. Ice and snow on the Earth’s surface occur in various forms such 
as frost, sea ice, and glacier ice. When soil moisture freezes, ice also occurs beneath the Earth’s surface, forming permafrost in tundra climates.</p>
