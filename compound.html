<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>How it is important and useful for the environment and Humans:</b></p> 
  
   <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
 Traditional soap is generally biodegradable, meaning it breaks down naturally over time without causing harm to the environment. 
 This is an essential factor in assessing its environmental impact. Furthermore, soaps are very essential for our personal hygiene. 
 We use them in order to wash our hands, our faces and our bodies but also to wash our dishes, our clothes and all the surfaces we come in contact with.</p>
 
 <p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>USES:</b></p>
   <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
   Soap works as an extremely effective cleanser. Not only does it cleanse by removing dirt and oil from the skin’s surface, it also sanitizes by destroying microbes, 
   bacteria and viruses. The majority of us use soap to cleanse our hands, face or body at least once per day.

  <h1 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;">WATER</h1>
  <hr style="width: 60%;">
  
 <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
 Water is a compound composed of the elements hydrogen and oxygen, with 2 atoms of hydrogen (H) and one atom of oxygen (O). 
 It exists in gaseous, liquid, and solid states. It is also one of the most plentiful and essential compounds. Water is a tasteless and odorless liquid at room temperature, 
 it has the important ability to dissolve many other substances.
</p>
  
  <p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>How it is important and useful for the environment and Humans:</b></p> 
 <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
Water is provided to homes, farms, schools and businesses. Along the way they nourish entire ecosystems and provide important habitat for native plants and animals. 
Water for the environment is used to target specific outcomes for plants or animals by providing the right amount of water at the right time for them to feed, breed and grow. 
It also plays a vital role for humans to keep the bloodstream liquid enough to flow through blood vessels. It helps eliminate the by-products of the body’s metabolism, excess 
electrolytes (for example, sodium and potassium), and urea, which is a waste product formed through the processing of dietary protein.
</p>
  
  <p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>USES:</b></p>
   <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
  People have learned to get and use water for all of their needs, from drinking, cleaning, irrigating crops, producing electricity, medical uses, and for just having fun. 
  It is also used as our universal solvent.

  <h1 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;">CARBON DIOXIDE</h1>
  <hr style="width: 60%;">
  
  <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
  Carbon dioxide (commonly abbreviated as CO2) is a clear gas composed of one atom of carbon (C) and two atoms of oxygen (O). 
  Carbon dioxide is one of many molecules where carbon is commonly found on the Earth.
 </p>
  
  <p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>How it is important and useful for the environment and Humans:</b></p> 
 <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
   Studies have shown that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide increase photosynthesis, spurring plant growth. While rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the air
   can be beneficial for plants, it is also the chief culprit of climate change. CO2 plays various roles in the human body including regulation of blood pH, respiratory drive, 
   and affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen (O2). Fluctuations in CO2 levels are highly regulated and can cause disturbances in the human body if normal levels are not maintained.
 </p>
  
  
  
  <p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>USES:</b></p>
   <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
 Carbon dioxide is used as a refrigerant, in fire extinguishers, for inflating life rafts and life jackets, blasting coal, foaming rubber and plastics, promoting the growth 
 of plants in greenhouses, immobilizing animals before slaughter, and in carbonated beverages.

    <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
 Ethanol, a member of a class of organic compounds that are given the general name alcohols. Its molecular formula is C2H5OH. Ethanol is an important industrial chemical; 
 it is used as a solvent, in the synthesis of other organic chemicals, and as an additive to automotive gasoline (forming a mixture known as a gasohol). 
  </p>
  
  <p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>How it is important and useful for the environment and Humans:</b></p> 
 <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
  Grain-based ethanol cuts greenhouse gas emissions significantly—by 44 to 52% compared to gasoline, according to the Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory.
  Ethanol is renewable, non-toxic, water-soluble, and quickly biodegradable.
  </p>

  
  
    <p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>USES:</b></p>
   <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
   It is used as a topical agent to prevent skin infections, in pharmaceutical preparations (e.g. rubbing compounds, lotions, tonics, colognes), cosmetics, and in perfumes. 
   Ethanol is also commonly used as a high-octane fuel in vehicles due to its favorable properties such as lower evaporative emissions and reduced flammability compared to gasoline.

  <hr style="width: 60%;">
  

    <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
Acetylsalicylic acid commonly known as Aspirin is a prototypical analgesic with the chemical formula C9H8O4. It is one of the safest and most effective medicines and 
is an extensively used medication globally, which is displayed on the WHO’s List of Essential Medicines.
</p>


<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>How it is important and useful for the environment and Humans:</b></p> 
 <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
  The study revealed that aspirin, which naturally occurs in the bark of the willow tree and other plants, can improve the survival of grass species important for ecological 
  restoration and sustainable pasture when applied in a seed coating. In addition, Aspirin has been shown to be helpful and important for humans when used daily to lower the risk of 
  heart attack, clot-related strokes and other blood flow problems in patients who have cardiovascular disease or who have already had a heart attack or stroke.
</p>


<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>USES:</b></p>
   <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
  "Our research found that aspirin can do more than just ease a headache; it can also help restore degraded land and ecosystems and establish sustainable pastures 
  through improving plant growth and survival," Dr Pedrini said. Aspirin is an everyday painkiller for aches and pains such as headache, toothache and period pain. 
  It can also be used to treat colds and flu-like symptoms, and to bring down a high temperature.

  <h1 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;">SODIUM NITRATE</h1>
  <hr style="width: 60%;">
   
   
  <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
  Sodium nitrate(NaNO3) is a nitrate of sodium. It is used as an ingredient in fertilizers, pyrotechnics, as a food preservative, and as a solid rocket propellant, 
  and also in glass and pottery enamels. Nitrite is a toxic compound known to cause methemoglobinemia.
</p>
  
 <p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>How it is important and useful for the environment and Humans:</b></p> 
 <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;"> 
 Sodium nitrate provides a rapid boost to plant growth. It can be an important part of an overall nitrogen management strategy for many types of crops. 
 Moreover, Sodium nitrate is metabolized in the body and meats into sodium nitrite, which has been found to have medicinal qualities, such as improved oxygen circulation a
 nd can be helpful during heart attacks and strokes. It plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure, neurotransmission, and immune function. 
 Nitrates enhance cardiovascular health by lowering blood pressure.
 </p>
  
  <p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>USES:</b></p>
   <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;"> 
   Sodium nitrate and nitrite are extensively used in the food industry as an antioxidant in meats such as bacon, ham, luncheon meats, deli meat, jerky and hotdogs.
   Nitrates are the most oxidized form of nitrogen present in soil and water, in the form of highly soluble and mobile mineral salts. They are assimilable by plants and 
   serve as a basis for the nitrogenous diet of many cultivated plants. They can also be assimilated by soil microorganisms in competition with plants.
