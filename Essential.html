  <div style="text-align:center; margin-top:40px;"><img src="hydrogen.jpeg" height="20%" width="20%">
  <h1 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;">HYDROGEN</h1>
  <hr style="width: 60%;">
  
  <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">Hydrogen is the simplest element
Each atom of hydrogen has only one proton. Hydrogen is also the most abundant element in the universe. 
The sun, and other stars, are essentially giant balls of hydrogen and helium gasses.
Hydrogen occurs naturally on earth in compound form with other elements in liquids, gasses, or solids. 
Hydrogen combined with oxygen is water (H2O). Hydrogen combined with carbon forms different compounds—or hydrocarbons—that are found in natural gas, coal, and petroleum.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>
How it is important and useful for the environment and 
Humans:</b></p>

<p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
It can be used in fuel cells to generate electricity and heat, making it a potential energy source for buildings and electric vehicles. 
It can also be used to store renewable energy, helping to balance the supply and demand on the power grid. In industry, 
hydrogen can be used as a feedstock to produce a range of chemicals and fuels.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>USES:</b></p>

<p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
 Hydrogen is used in industrial processes, as a rocket fuel, and in fuel cells for electricity generation and powering vehicles. 
 Operators of several natural gas-fired power plants are 
 exploring hydrogen as a supplement or replacement for natural gas. Hydrogen has the potential to indirectly store energy for electric power generation.</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;">PHOSPHORUS</h1>
  <hr style="width: 60%;">
  

<p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
Phosphorus (P) is the 15th element in the periodic table of elements with an atomic mass of 30.974 (31 when rounded off). 
There are two main forms of phosphorus, which are the white phosphorus and the red phosphorus. The white phosphorus is a poisonous waxy solid which 
can cause severe burns when it comes in contact with skin. It glows in the dark and is spontaneously flammable when exposed to air. On the other hand, 
red phosphorus is an amorphous non-toxic solid.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>How it is important and useful for the environment and humans:</b></p>

<p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
 Phosphorus is essential to all living things. It forms the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA and RNA. It is 
 important for energy transfer in cells as part of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), and is found in many other biologically important molecules. 
 We take in about 1 gram of phosphate a day, and store about 750 grams in our bodies, since our bones and teeth are mainly calcium phosphate. 
 Over-use of phosphates from fertilizers and detergents can cause them to pollute rivers and lakes causing algae to grow rapidly. The algae block out light, 
 stopping further photosynthesis. Oxygen dissolved in the water soon gets used up and the lake dies.</p>
 
<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>USES:</b></p>

<p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
 White phosphorus is used in flares and incendiary devices. Red phosphorus is in the material stuck on the side of matchboxes, used to strike 
 safety matches against to light them. Phosphorus is also important in the production of steel. Phosphates are ingredients in some detergents,
 but are beginning to be phased out in some countries. This is because they can lead to high phosphate levels in natural water supplies causing unwanted algae to grow. 
 Phosphates are also used in the production of special glasses and fine chinaware.</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;">ALUMINUM</h1>
  <hr style="width: 60%;">

<p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
 Aluminum (Al), chemical element, a lightweight silvery white metal of main Group 13 (IIIa, or boron group) of the periodic table.
 Aluminum is the most abundant metallic element in Earth’s crust and the most widely used nonferrous metal. Because of its chemical activity, aluminum never occurs in 
 the metallic form in nature, but its compounds are present to a greater or lesser extent in almost all rocks, vegetation, and animals. Aluminum is concentrated in the outer 
 16 km (10 miles) of Earth’s crust, of which it constitutes about 8 percent by weight; it is exceeded in amount only by oxygen and silicon. 
 The name aluminum is derived from the Latin word alumen, used to describe potash alum, or aluminum potassium sulfate, KAl(SO4)2∙12H2O.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>How it is important and useful for the environment and humans:</b></p>

<p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
 It's the commonest metal in Earth's crust (making up ~8 percent of it), the third most plentiful chemical element on our planet (only oxygen and silicon exist in greater quantity), 
 and the second most popular metal for making things (after iron/steel). [4] We all see and use aluminum every day without even thinking about it. Disposable drinks cans are made 
 from it and so is cooking foil.</p>
 
 <p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>USES:</b></p>

<p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
Aluminum is used in a huge variety of products including cans, foils, kitchen utensils, window frames, beer kegs and aeroplane parts. 
This is because of its particular properties. It has low density, is non-toxic, has a high thermal conductivity, has excellent corrosion resistance and can be easily cast, 
machined and formed.</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;">CHLORINE</h1>
  <hr style="width: 60%;">
  
  <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
Chlorine is a greenish yellow gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. It is two and a half times heavier than air. 
It becomes a liquid at −34 °C (−29 °F). It has a choking smell, and inhalation causes suffocation, constriction of the chest, tightness in the throat, 
—after severe exposure—edema (filling with fluid) of the lungs. As little as one part per thousand in air causes death within a few minutes, but less than one part per million may
be tolerated. Chlorine was the first gas used in chemical warfare in World War I. The gas is easily liquefied by cooling or by pressures of a few atmospheres at ordinary temperature.
Chlorine has a high electronegativity and a high electron affinity, the latter being even slightly higher than that of fluorine. </p>

<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>How it is important and useful for the environment and humans:</b></p>

  <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
Chlorine is generally produced from ordinary salt. The chlorine production process is efficient: hydrogen, a byproduct of production process, is used as an energy source in many 
manufacturing facilities; and sodium hydroxide, another byproduct, is used to manufacture many consumer and industrial products.
Chlorine chemistry helps keep drinking water and swimming pools safe, and is used to manufacture household chlorine bleach, which can whiten and disinfect clothes and disinfect 
kitchen and bathroom surfaces. Chlorine chemistry is used in the manufacture of numerous products ranging from contact lenses, air conditioning refrigerants and solar panels, 
to bullet-resistant vests, energy-efficient windows, paint and prosthetics.</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;">IRON</h1>
  <hr style="width: 60%;">
  
     <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;"> 
	 Iron (Fe) is the 26th element in the periodic table of elements with an atomic mass of 55.845 (56 when rounded off). Iron is the fourth most abundant element, by mass, in the Earth’s crust.
	 The core of the Earth is thought to be largely composed of iron with nickel and sulfur. The most common iron-containing ore is haematite, but iron is found widely distributed in other minerals such as magnetite and taconite.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>How it is important and useful for the environment and humans:</b></p>
      <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
Iron is one of the essential elements for all forms of life and is non-toxic. In fact, the average human contains about 4 grams of iron. A lot of this is in hemoglobin, which is found in the blood.
 Hemoglobin carries oxygen from our lungs to the cells, where it is needed for tissue respiration. Humans need 10–18 milligrams of iron each day. The lack of iron causes iron-deficiency or anemia to develop. 
 Foods such as liver, kidney, molasses, brewer’s yeast, cocoa and liquorice contain a lot of iron.</p>
 
  <p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>USES:</b></p>

 <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
 
 90% of metal that is refined today is iron. Most is used to manufacture steel, used in civil engineering (reinforced concrete, girders etc) and in manufacturing. It can also be found in the making of bridges,
 electricity pylons, bicycle chains, cutting tools and rifle barrels. </p>

  <h1 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;">OXYGEN</h1>
  <hr style="width: 60%;">
  
 <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;"> 
Oxygen (O) is the 8th element in the periodic table of elements and it has an atomic mass of 15.999  (16 when rounded off). It is a colorless and odorless gas. It makes up 21% of the atmosphere by volume. 
This is halfway between 17% (below which breathing for unacclimatized people becomes difficult) and 25% (above which many organic compounds are highly flammable). The element and its compounds make up 49.2% by mass of the Earth’s 
crust, and about two-thirds of the human body.</p>
	  


<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>How it is important and useful for the environment and humans:</b></p>
      <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
	 Oxygen first appeared in the Earth’s atmosphere around 2 billion years ago, accumulating from the photosynthesis of blue-green algae. Photosynthesis uses energy from the sun to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. 
	 The oxygen passes into the atmosphere and the hydrogen joins with carbon dioxide to produce biomass. When living things need energy they take in oxygen for respiration. The oxygen returns to the atmosphere in the form of 
	 carbon dioxide. Oxygen gas is fairly soluble in water, which makes aerobic life in rivers, lakes and oceans possible.
 </p>


 <p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>USES:</b></p>

 <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
 The greatest commercial use of oxygen gas is in the steel industry. Large quantities are also used in the manufacture of a wide range of chemicals including nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. 
 It is also used to make epoxyethane (ethylene oxide), used as antifreeze and to make polyester, and chloroethene, the precursor to PVC. Oxygen gas is also used for oxy-acetylene welding and cutting of metals. 
 A growing use is in the treatment of sewage and of effluent from industry.</p>

  <hr style="width: 60%;">
  
   <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;"> 
Nitrogen (N)  is the 7th element in the periodic table of elements with an atomic mass of 14.007 (14 when rounded off). It is also a colorless and odorless gas. It makes up 78% of the air, by volume,
 making it the most abundant gas in the atmosphere. It is obtained by the distillation of liquid air. Around 45 million tonnes are extracted each year. It is found, as compounds, in all living things and hence also in 
 coal and other fossil fuels.

 <p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>How it is important and useful for the environment and humans:</b></p>
      <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
	   Nitrogen is cycled naturally by living organisms through the ‘nitrogen cycle’. It is taken up by green plants and algae as nitrates, and used to build up the bases needed to construct DNA,
	   RNA and all amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Animals obtain their nitrogen by consuming other living things. They digest the proteins and DNA into their constituent bases and amino acids, 
	   reforming them for their own use. Microbes in the soil convert the nitrogen compounds back to nitrates for the plants to reuse. The nitrate supply is also replenished by nitrogen-fixing bacteria that ‘fix’ nitrogen 
	   directly from the atmosphere.
</p>
  
  <p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>USES:</b></p>

 <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
 Nitrogen is used to make fertilizers, nitric acid, nylon, dyes and explosives. To make these products, nitrogen must first be reacted with hydrogen to produce ammonia. 
 Nitrogen gas is also used to preserve foods, and in the electronics industry during the production of transistors and diodes. Large quantities of nitrogen are used in annealing stainless steel 
 and other steel mill products. Liquid nitrogen is often used as a refrigerant. It is used for storing sperm, eggs and other cells for medical research and reproductive technology. 
 It is also used to rapidly freeze foods, helping them to maintain moisture, color, flavor and texture.

  <hr style="width: 60%;">

   <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;"> 
Mercury was known in Egypt and also probably in the East as early as 1500 bce. The name mercury originated in 6th-century alchemy, in which the symbol of the planet was used to represent the metal; 
the chemical symbol Hg derives from the Latin hydrargyrum, “liquid silver.” Although its toxicity was recognized at an early date, its main application was for medical purposes. Liquid mercury beads and a glass container.
Mercury is the only elemental metal that is liquid at room temperature. Mercury is silvery white, slowly tarnishes in moist air, and freezes into a soft solid like tin or lead at −38.83 °C (−37.89 °F). 
It boils at 356.62 °C (673.91 °F).
</p>


<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>How it is important and useful for the environment and humans:</b></p>
      <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
It’s still widely used in fluorescent bulbs and dental amalgam. It’s used to make the organometallic compound thimerosal, which preserves some vaccines, cosmetics, and contact lens solutions. 
The topical antiseptic merbromin or Mercurochrome remains in use in some countries. Mercury finds use in batteries, gold and silver mining, and making felt hats. While the element isn’t used much for these applications today, 
environmental clean-up from the past remains a concern. Commercially, mercury is used to make chlorine from sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide from metallic sodium. Mercury fulminate is used as a primer in small arms 
and pyrotechnics.
</p>



<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:center;"><b>USES:</b></p>

 <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
 It is used in making electrical switches, a shield and a coolant in nuclear reactors, and fungicides. It is also used in the Dental Industry,Main use in production of dental amalgam, B.P apparatus (sphygmomanometers), 
 and thermometers.
