<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">	
All substances, including water, become less dense when they are heated and more dense when they are cooled. So if water is cooled, it becomes more dense and forms ice. 
Water is one of the few substances whose solid state can float on its liquid state! Why? Water continues to become more dense until it reaches 4°C. After it reaches 4°C, it 
becomes LESS dense. When freezing, molecules within water begin to move around more slowly, making it easier for them to form hydrogen bonds and eventually arrange themselves into an 
open crystalline, hexagonal structure. Because of this open structure as the water molecules are being held further apart, the volume of water increases about 9%. 
So molecules are more tightly packed in water's liquid state than its solid state. This is why a can of soda can explode in the freezer.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;"><font color="#1B7396" face="comic sans ms">Liquid State (Liquid Water)</h1></font>
<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
It is very rare to find a compound that lacks carbon to be a liquid at standard temperatures and pressures. So it is unusual for water to be a liquid at room temperature! 
Water is liquid at room temperature so it's able to move around quicker than it is as solid, enabling the molecules to form fewer hydrogen bonds resulting in the molecules being 
packed more closely together. Each water molecule links to four others creating a tetrahedral arrangement, however they are able to move freely and slide past each other, 
while ice forms a solid, larger hexagonal structure.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;"><font color="#1B7396" face="comic sans ms">Gas State (Steam)</h1></font>
<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
As water boils, its hydrogen bonds are broken. Steam particles move very far apart and fast, so barely any hydrogen bonds have the time to form. So, less and less hydrogen bonds 
are present as the particles reach the critical point above steam. The lack of hydrogen bonds explains why steam causes much worse burns than water. Steam contains all 
the energy used to break the hydrogen bonds in water, so when steam hits your face you first absorb the energy the steam has taken up from breaking the hydrogen bonds in its 
liquid state. Then, in an exothermic reaction, steam is converted into liquid water and heat is released. This heat adds to the heat of boiling water as the steam 
condenses on your skin.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;"><font color="#1B7396" face="comic sans ms">Water as the "Universal Solvent"</h1></font>
<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
Because of water's polarity, it is able to dissolve or dissociate many particles. Oxygen has a slightly negative charge, while the two hydrogens have a slightly positive charge. 
The slightly negative particles of a compound will be attracted to water's hydrogen atoms, while the slightly positive particles will be attracted to water's oxygen molecule; 
this causes the compound to dissociate. Besides the explanations above, we can look to some attributes of a water molecule to provide some more reasons of water's uniqueness:
Forgetting fluorine, oxygen is the most electronegative non-noble gas element, so while forming a bond, the electrons are pulled towards the oxygen atom rather 
than the hydrogen. This creates 2 polar bonds, which make the water molecule more polar than the bonds in the other hydrides in the group. A 104.5° bond angle creates a very 
strong dipole. Water has hydrogen bonding which probably is a vital aspect in water's strong intermolecular interaction.

<h4>Why is this important for the real world?</h4>

<p style="font-size:15px; text-align:justify; line-height: 30px; margin:50px;">
The properties of water make it suitable for organisms to survive in during differing weather conditions. Ice freezes as it expands, which explains why ice is able to float on 
liquid water. During the winter when lakes begin to freeze, the surface of the water freezes and then moves down toward deeper water; this explains why people can ice skate on
or fall through a frozen lake. If ice was not able to float, the lake would freeze from the bottom up killing all ecosystems living in the lake. However ice floats, so the fish 
are able to survive under the surface of the ice during the winter. The surface of ice above a lake also shields lakes from the cold temperature outside and insulates the water 
beneath it, allowing the lake under the frozen ice to stay liquid and maintain a temperature adequate for the ecosystems living in the lake to survive. Water also carries vitamins 
and minerals to and from the cells, and is vital in removing waste products from individual cells, as shown by research in the Biochemical Journal. Further, water consumption 
ensures appropriate blood volume, viscosity, and circulation, which is vital for the proper function of all organs and tissues of the body. Water is also vitally important for 
regulating body temperature. It has a great capacity to store heat, preventing large, rapid drops in internal temperature, and through sweating, water has arguably the most efficient 
avenue to lose heat when environmental temperature is higher than body temperature.

Finally, water is essential to form many bodily fluids: tears, saliva, sweat, urine, and blood, amongst others. Water is also a highly effective lubricant for joints helping to produce 
synovial fluid and cartilage, which help keep joints healthy through smooth movements. Water also helps with joint health by maintaining cells’ shapes, acting as a shock absorber 
during impacting activities like walking or running, which even protects the brain and spinal cord.</p>
